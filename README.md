In this project, we took the clinic's needs seriously and thought how to solve their problems and to create a healthy enviroment and flexible system for the employees to work in.
We made our request for proposal on different phases and that contained the main system features that our proposed system will support along with the added features that we suggest in order to make the flow of their work smoother.
We built the use case diagrams that contain all use cases and the actors of them. then we built the UML class Diagram of the system that defines the main classes that will be implemented in our proposed system.
After that we built the use case specification documents of the most important use cases in order to show for the client so we can ensure that we  are on the same page.
Last things were the diagrams that we added which were the activity diagrams , the component diagram and the deployment diagram that defines the system's main architecture features.
It was a very powerful and beneficial project because it gave us a glimpse of the software projects management processes.
